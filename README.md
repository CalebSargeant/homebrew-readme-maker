│   └── readme.test.js  # Test cases for README generation
│
└── package.json        # Project metadata and dependencies
```

## Usage
To generate a README file, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run generate -- <project-name>
```

Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your project. This command will create a `README.md` file in the current directory.

### Example
```bash
npm run generate -- my-awesome-project
```

This will generate a README file tailored for "my-awesome-project".

## Configuration
The `readme-maker` allows for customization through a configuration file located in the `/config` directory. The default settings can be modified in `settings.json`. Here’s an example configuration:

```json
{
  "projectName": "My Project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

You can customize fields such as `projectName`, `version`, `author`, and `license` to fit your project specifics.

## Troubleshooting and Known Issues
- **Common Issues**: If you encounter issues with generating the README, ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and that you are using the correct command syntax.
